Minisculus
===============

Minisculus is a a coding challenge loosely based on the historic efforts of the WWII code breakers. http://minisculuschallenge.com/

This repo contains my solutions to the challenges in [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)).

To run the code you'll need an APL interpreter, jq, and a recent install of wget. On OS X:

```
brew install gnu-apl
brew install wget
brew install jq
```
